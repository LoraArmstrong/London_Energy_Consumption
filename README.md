Exploring smart meter data for a sample of London households
===================

Exploration of smart electricity meter data from the London Data Store.  

**The data**: Half hourly readings from smart electricity meters in a representative group of about 5560 London households, from 2012-2014, plus affluence groupings from ACORN and tariff type.  

**The goal**: Provide an estimate of the peak demand and the date for that demand, for this group of houses in 2016.  

**The result**: Estimated peak demand is 75 Â± 2 MWH, on 10 January, 2015. 

In addition to this README file, this repo includes:  

* *GLA_EnergyConsumption.R*: R script to clean & merge data sources, explore data, and perform calculations needed for estimating peak demand and date.  

* *Plots*: Five pdf files visualising various interesting aspects of the dataset.
